# Rich domain model

What is Rich domain ? 

Let's define first what is the opposite of rich domain

## Anaemic Domain Model

### Looks like a real domain object

  - Named after the nouns of the domain (order, payment, billing, project..)
  - Are connected to a rich relationships (deliveryMethods, products, paymentMethods...)
  - They are no business rules implemented inside
  - Bag of setters and getters

### Where the business logic ?

  - Set of services that captures all data an apply all the business logic.

  - Utilities, factories, mapper classes that share logic between multiple services ([DRY](https://almostengineer.medium.com/dry-principle-of-software-development-common-mistake-15510cfea53e]))

### Why this is an Anti-pattern ?

  - Procedural programming, manipulate data and share them between objects
  - Contrary of the basic idea of OOP
    - Combine data and behaviors
  - Breaks encapsulation
    - Object state are exposed
    - Getters/Setters
  - Coupling and Low cohesion

### Why this is a common practice ?

  - Some technologies encourage it
    - ORMs
    - Lombook
    - Mapstruct
    > Donâ€™t marry the framework. Robert C. Martin
    - Some books and academic articles
